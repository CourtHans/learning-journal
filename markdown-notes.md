# Class 1: Markdown
Markdown is a "lightweight markup language" that allows us to work quickly and “makes styled collaborative editing easy.” Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` and `*`. What can you do when you’re stuck or can’t remember how to markup for a certain desired result? [Google](www.google.com) it, of course. 

__A few examples:__
-	`*This text will be italic*` will show up up like this:*This text will be italic.*
-	To insert a hyperlink, employ box brackets `[ ]` around the text you wish to display, and parentheses `( )` around the url. `[Google](www.google.com)` will show up like this -> [Google](www.google.com)
- Inserting a `>` will give you indented blockquotes. Entering this text on a new line: `>"Failure to prepare is preparing to fail."` will result in this rendering:
>"Failure to prepare is preparing to fail."

In keeping with a growth mindset, I intend to keep practicing, trying out crazy stuff, seeing what works and what doesn't, and asking for help when I get stuck.

GitHub pages provide a simple, elegant solution for sharing your work, collaborating with teams on a project, and document progress. For further customization, you can employ Jekyll. You can visit [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) to learn more.

Research for tomorrow: which is better for a numbered list – using the same numeral (all “1s”) or using the proper ordinals (1, 2, 3) and why?
