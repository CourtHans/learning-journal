# Class 1: Growth mindset

In my opinion, a concept that is **central** to the idea of a growth mindset is failure. As a society, we’re so driven toward success and enviable accomplishments, that it can be easy to forget that it’s nearly impossible to achieve any modicum of success without failure. We know this, and yet, we're still afraid.

It's important to remember that we’re not born knowing how to do things. We __are__, however, born with insatiable curiosity. As we grow older, that curiosity tends to be overshadowed by the desire for comfort. Hot tip: the more you step outside your comfort zone, ___the bigger it becomes___. 

Failure is the best teacher: it is visceral, personal, and – with a growth mindset – motivating.

Remember:
>Failure creates the same amount of progress as success!

### Keeping a growth mindset means:
1. Staying open to all forms of feedback
2. Persisting in the face of obstacles
3. Being comfortable with discomfort
