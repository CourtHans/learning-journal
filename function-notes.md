# Class 7: Function Notes

### Keywords

- **declaration** - "before you use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it" - you name, or **declare** the variable or variable. This is when you define the function, when the logic is created, when the entire function is *created*
- **parameters** - pieces of information passed to a function (the information the computer needs to perform/achieve a given task). "a special type of variable created and used in a specific function" (you can use that word in multple places, though, but it will mean something specific in that function)
- **arguments** - sometimes confused/conflated with parameters. *Arguments are the values* that you pass into the code (the information it needs to calculate when a function has parameters) When you ***call*** your function, you pass values as arguments, and those arguments take the place of your parameters.
- **return statement** - when you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, you call the function with a return statement. The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function. This manages the output. 
- **naming convention** - if a variable name is more than one word, use camelCase (remember JavaScript is case sensitive) 
- **local variable** - a variable declared INSIDE a function
- **global variables** - a variable created in the GLOBAL namespace, or outside the functions

> Remember that programming languages often rely upon name/value pairs. 

***Functions*** let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. *"Functions are portable logic.* Functions save time...(and, according to Ryan, "developers are lazy").

If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as **calling** the function.

Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**.

**`document.write()` is an example of a method (we'll learn more about this later). For right now, it's a "function that we get for free'

**When to use return** - when you get in to different data types, you may modify a variable, you many not necessarily need to return it. For the purposes of this class, always use them.
