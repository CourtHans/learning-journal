## What makes a computer a computer?

All computers do 4 different tasks:
* Take input
* Store information
* Process information
* Output results

## Binary & Data

On/off state of single wire is a bit and is the smallest amount of info a computer can store.

Binary system for counting uses a factor of 2. E.g. with 8 wires you can store numbers between 0 and 255. With 32 wires, you can store numbers from **0** to **over 4 billion**.

***Text, images, sound*** can also be represented with numbers.  
*text* = you can assign each letter a number, and then a word, paragraph can be conveyed through a sequence of numbers. 

*photos, videos, graphics* = each of the pixels = color, each color can be represented with numbers

*sound* = vibrations can be represented graphically by a waveform. Every point on this waveform can be represented by a number, so any sound can be broken down by those numbers.

## Circuits & Logic

Every input or output of a comuter is effectively a type **information** which can be represented by 1s and 0s. In order to process the input into the output, computer needs to modify and combine the input signals. To do this, it uses millions of tiny electronic components which come together to form circuits.

>A simple circuit takes an electric signal and flips it.
Complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results.

Connecting circuits together allows for more complex calculations. All the information processing your computer does is just lots and lots small, simple operations put together. The smaller the circuit, the faster the calculations, because the electric signals move at *just about* the speed of light. 

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

To display a letter of input (i.e. from your keyboard to your screen), a computer has to run thousands of instructions through storage and processiong. Outputs can create sounds, on control physical motion. New types of inputs and outputs interact with the world in entirely new ways. This is aiding in the advancements in size and speed of CPU. Modern computers performing complex tasks/ouputs may need multiple CPUs to process all that information *and* many gigabytes of memory to store it.

## Hardware & Software

*CPU* is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. Inside, it has smaller, simpler parts that handle single tasks. The real magic is how it knows which circuits to use and when to use them. Enter: the operating system.

The **operating system** is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. It's the operating system that is quickly controlling which programs have access to the computer's input and output systems.
