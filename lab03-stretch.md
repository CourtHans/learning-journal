# Class 3: Stretch

**Lab 03 Stretch Goals**
> *What did this exercise teach you? Add an additional page to your learning journal site to document your learnings.*

As I wrapped up my changes in Lab 03 and (*internally*) celebrated my successful A-C-P, I realized I had a few errors (a missed "." here, a different-sized header there, etc.). I went back in to VSCode to edit and pushed changes again with a message akin to "a few more changes" (and again celebrated the successful change).

Then I realized I wanted to add some additional navigation features to my page to improve the reader's experience. I added a [Table of Contents link](README.md) to the top of each page as well as linking the previous and next posts at the bottom of each page.

***SO***...I pushed all the changes again with the message "final changes." I looked at my pretty page(s) on the web and...

drum roll, please...

Found more errors.

I believe I made - and pushed - about 5 rounds of changes locally. After which, I stopped to ask myself... is this the best practice? That's a lot of silly message lines...it's probably better to triple or quadruple check my text and code in VSCode and limit my pushes. 

And then I read about the Stretch assignment, so here we go with one more push for the night! At least the repetition has drilled in the following:

```
git status
git add {file name(s)}
git status
git commit -m "{brief description of WHY I made the changes}"
git status
git push origin master
git status
```

Et voila!
