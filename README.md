## Growth mindset

In my opinion, a concept that is **central** to the idea of a growth mindset is failure. As a society, we’re so driven toward success and enviable accomplishments, that it can be easy to forget that it’s nearly impossible to achieve any modicum of success without failure. We know this, and yet, we're still afraid.

It's important to remember that we’re not born knowing how to do things. We __are__, however, born with insatiable curiosity. As we grow older, that curiosity tends to be overshadowed by the desire for comfort. Hot tip: the more you step outside your comfort zone, ___the bigger it becomes___. 

Failure is the best teacher: it is visceral, personal, and – with a growth mindset – motivating.

Remember:
>Failure creates the same amount of progress as success!

### Keeping a growth mindset means:
1. Staying open to all forms of feedback
2. Persisting in the face of obstacles
3. Being comfortable with discomfort

Although when you need a break, it *can* be entertaining to watch [Funny Fail Videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aK8hy50fS4).


### Class 01: Markdown
Markdown is a "lightweight markup language" that allows us to work quickly and “makes styled collaborative editing easy.” Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` and `*`. What can you do when you’re stuck or can’t remember how to markup for a certain desired result? [Google](www.google.com), of course. 

__A few examples:__
-	`*This text will be italic*` will show up up like this:*This text will be italic.*
- Inserting a `>` will give you indented blockquotes. Entering this: `>"Failure to prepare is preparing to fail."` Will result in this:
>"Failure to prepare is preparing to fail."
-	To insert a hyperlink, employ box brackets `[ ]` around the text you wish to display, and parentheses `( )` around the url. 
>`[Google](www.google.com)` will show up like this [Google](www.google.com),

GitHub pages provide a simple, elegant solution for sharing your work, collaborating with teams on a project, and document progress. For further customization, you can employ Jekyll. You can visit [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) to learn more.

Research for tomorrow: which is better for a numbered list – using the same numeral (all “1s”) or using the proper ordinals (1, 2, 3) and why?
